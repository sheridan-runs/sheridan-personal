      "We had our best month ever... so why can't we make payroll?"
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
      I have heard this question more times than I can count. It is the sound of a business owner realising that their Profit & Loss (P&L) statement is, in many ways, a work of fiction.
    </p>

    <hr class="border-slate-800 my-8" />

    <p class="mb-6">
      There is an old saying in finance: <em>Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, but cash is king.</em>
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I prefer a slightly different version: <strong>Profit is theory. Cash is reality.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="mb-8">
      Over the years, my core service has been building cash flow forecasts for growing companies. Why? Because you can survive for years without a profit, but you die in days without cash.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-6">The "Rich on Paper" Trap</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Most founders run their business from the P&L. They look at the bottom line, see a healthy net profit, and assume they are safe. But accounting profit is an opinion. It relies on accruals, paper transactions, and timing differences.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-slate-800/50 p-6 rounded-xl border border-slate-700 mb-8">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-slate-300 marker:text-emerald-500">
        <li>You <strong>invoice</strong> a client for $50,000 today.</li>
        <li>Your P&L says you made $50,000 <strong>today</strong>.</li>
        <li>But if the client pays in 90 days, you have $0 in the bank to pay your staff <strong>tomorrow</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="mb-8">
      If you rely solely on your P&L, you are driving your business while looking in the rearview mirror. You can see exactly where you've been, but you can't see the cliff approaching in front of you.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-6">The Growth Paradox</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Here is the counter-intuitive truth I tell my clients: <strong>Growth is expensive.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      When a business grows fast, it gets hungry.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-slate-300 marker:text-emerald-500 mb-6">
      <li>You need to buy more stock <em>before</em> you sell it.</li>
      <li>You need to hire more people <em>before</em> the new revenue hits.</li>
      <li>You need to upgrade software <em>before</em> the efficiency gains kick in.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-8">
      This is the "Cash Flow Cycle." If your cash outflow (expenses) runs faster than your cash inflow (income), you create a <strong>cash gap</strong> - a difference in timing that needs to be funded. I have seen profitable, thriving businesses hit the wall simply because they grew too fast for their cash cycle to keep up.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-6">The Solution: The Cash Flow Forecast</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      You cannot fix this by looking at Xero or MYOB. Those tools record history. To manage cash, you need to predict the future. This is where <strong>Cash Flow Forecasting</strong> comes in.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      When I work with clients, we build a rolling forecast. We strip away the accounting jargon ("EBITDA," "Depreciation") and focus on the physics of money:
    </p>

    <div class="bg-slate-800/50 p-6 rounded-xl border-l-4 border-emerald-500 mb-8">
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-4 text-slate-200">
        <li><strong>Who is paying us?</strong> (And when will the money <em>actually</em> land?)</li>
        <li><strong>Who do we have to pay?</strong> (Payroll, rent, taxes, suppliers).</li>
        <li><strong>The Answer:</strong> What is the number at the bottom? Your bank balance is the source of truth.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p class="mb-8">
      If that number dips below zero in Week 6, we have six weeks to fix it. We can chase up overdue invoices, delay a purchase, or draw on an overdraft. But if you don't have the forecast, you won't know about the problem until Week 6 arrives. And by then, it’s too late.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Financial Strategy Requires Cash</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Strategy is about making choices. But if you have no cash, you have no choices. You are forced to make bad sales, cut marketing spend, and lose talent just to survive.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      If you want to be strategic, you first have to understand your cash flow. Stop looking at your profit and thinking you've won. Profit doesn’t keep the lights on, cash flow does.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-8">
      Make sure you're flicking the right switch.
    </p>
